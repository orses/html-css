## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM names for CSS class
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS variables
- CSS media queries

### What I learned

- It has made me work all the time with the mobile in mind as the initial premise (mobile first workflow).
- The use of BEM to name CSS classes.
- How to insert and manage SVG icons
- Use a single media query to handle all available viewport response.

### Continued development

Further developing semantics, BEM names, and looking into reusable CSS design patterns.
Try to make the measurements more associated or dependent on the text (padding, margin, line-height, etc.)
