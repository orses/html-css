## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM names for CSS class
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS variables

### What I learned

The development of grid has been interesting to adapt to responsive design with three types of layouts: for mobile, for tablet and desktop.
Also interesting is the use of CSS variables from the HTML code, to apply colors to the upper borders of the cards.
I continued with the practice of embedding local fonts in CSS.

### Continued development

Continue working with grid to see its potential and specify its applications.
Continue with inline svg files to work with their properties from CSS.
