## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM names for CSS class
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS variables

### What I learned

How to use the clamp function to linearly scale the font and the line-height property.

### Continued development

The way to change the location of the image based on the type of device, trying to make the transition as light and harmonious as possible. So far, using flex to change the order makes the transition from one state to another not very smooth.

### Useful resources

- [Linearly Scale font-size with CSS clamp() Based on the Viewport by Pedro Rodr√≠guez](https://css-tricks.com/linearly-scale-font-size-with-css-clamp-based-on-the-viewport/) - This post explains the use of clamp() its interest to scale fonts, and offers a utility to calculate the necessary transitions based on the pixel defined by the browser, the user or the programmer.
