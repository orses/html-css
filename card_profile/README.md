### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Every Layout by Heydon Pickering](https://every-layout.dev/rudiments/boxes/) - I find this way of approaching CSS layout very interesting. It allows you to think in a more flexible way and without being so subject to the dimensions of the possible devices.
