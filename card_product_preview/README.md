## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM names for CSS class
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Every Layout design
- CSS variables
- CSS media queries

### What I learned

I have learned to think in Every Layout mode, and it has been quite a challenge to adapt it to this project. At all times I tried to use CSS without resorting to media queries and practically everything was fine.
The project required changing the images and padding of the text area, which ultimately made me have to use a media query.

### Continued development

I have tried to use Heydon Pickering's Every Layout way of designing and approaching responsive design. However, by trying to make it look a lot like the project, not everything can be applied in its entirety, but some components such as Cover, Center, Stack and Switcher can.
It is the first time that I use it and therefore I am not very confident that I have made a good approximation. I am interested in following this path.

### Useful resources

- [Excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com/) - This helped me think about the structure and visualize the component better, thus thinking about the classes to use.
- [Every Layout by Heydon Pickering](https://every-layout.dev/rudiments/boxes/) - I find this way of approaching CSS layout very interesting. It allows you to think in a more flexible way and without being so subject to the dimensions of the possible devices.
