## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM names for CSS class
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS variables
- CSS media queries
- JavaScript IIFE functions and event listener

### What I learned

- It has made me work all the time with the mobile in mind as the initial premise (mobile first workflow).
- The use of BEM to name CSS classes.
- Position an element (Share link) so that it is always visible, even if a component is called that by default occupies its place overlapping.

### Continued development

Develop the semantics of a card type component and make it perfectly accessible to screens, keyboards and screen readers.
